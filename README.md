# AppDevFinale
Combination of my groups code and changes made to my own after the original presentation to take part in Outstanding Project Presentation. 

This project was a effort of 5 group members. 
1. Rayden (Products)
2. Dong En (Events)
3. Trisven (Login/Membership)
4. Azami (Rewards/Vouchers)
5. Izwan (Inventory/Suppliers)

The files here originally belong to another repository however in lieu of being nominated for the Outstanding Project Presentation, I have made changes to
the product section as I am to present my individual portion. 

Functions of other members in this repository may not function as intended as this is a modified copy for Products. 

To install all libaries/dependencies. 
 Run the command: pip install -r requirements.txt
